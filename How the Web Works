## DNS in Detail
-DNS: the Domain Name System provides a simple way to access a website instead of remembering the IP address, we only remember the tryhackme.com for example.

    1. What does DNS stand for? Domain Name System

-The domain name can be divided in 3 different sections: Top-Level Domain, Second-Level Domain and Subdomain.
-TLD: the Top-Level Domain is the most righthand part of a domain name. So, for example, the tryhackme.com TLD is .com. There are two types of TLD, gTLD (Generic Top Level) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain). Historically a gTLD was meant to
tell the user the domain name's purpose; for example, a .com would be for commercial purposes, .org for an organisation, .edu for education and .gov for government. And a ccTLD was used for geographical purposes, for example, .ca for sites based in Canada,.co.uk for sites
based in the United Kingdom and so on.
-Second-Level Domain: Taking tryhackme.com as an example, the .com part is the TLD, and tryhackme is the Second Level Domain. The second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens but cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens.
-Subdomain: A subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain using a period to separate it; for example, in the name admin.tryhackme.com the admin part is the subdomain. A subdomain name has the same creation restrictions as a Second-Level Domain. You can use multiple
subdomains split with periods to create longer names but the length must be kept to 253 characters or less. There is no limit to the number of subdomains you can create for your domain name.

    2. What is the maximum length of a subdomain? 63
    3. Which of the following characters cannot be used in a subdomain ( 3 b _ - )? _
    4. What is the maximum length of a domain name? 253
    5. What type of TLD is .co.uk? ccTLD

-DNS can be used for many other purpose than websites and so many DNS record exist:
-A Record: for IPv4 addresses
-AAAA Record: for IPv6 addresses
-CNAME Record: for domain name which return other domain name for example: TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com.
-MX Record: for emails (to direct them to the right servers)
-TXT Record: for arbitrary text

    6. What type of record would be used to advise where to send email? MX
    7. What type of record handles IPv6 addresses? AAAA

-What happens when you make a DNS request (5 steps):
1. When you request a domain name, your computer first checks its local cache to see if you've previously looked up the address recently; if not, a request to your Recursive DNS Server will be made.
2. A Recursive DNS Server: it's usually provided by your ISP, but you can also choose your own. This server also has a local cache of recently looked up domain names. If a result is found locally, this
is sent back to your computer, and your request ends here (this is common for popular and heavily requested services such as Google, Facebook, Twitter). If the request cannot be found locally, we go step 4.
3. Root DNS Server: their job is to redirect you to the correct Top Level Domain Server, depending on your request. If, for example, you request www.tryhackme.com, the root server will recognise the Top
Level Domain of .com and refer you to the correct TLD server that deals with .com addresses.
