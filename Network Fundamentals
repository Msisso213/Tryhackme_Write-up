# Network Fundamentals

## What is Networking
-When two or more devices are connected together, they make a network.

    1. What is the key term for devices that are connected together? Netwrok

-The Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together. These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks (Internet).

    2. Who invented the World Wide Web? Tim Berners-Lee

-To communicate and maintain order, devices must be both identifying and identifiable on a network. That is when IP addresses and MAC addresses come in place. 
-IP address (internet protocol address) can be used as a way of identifying a device on a network for a period of time. There is two type of IP adresses: public (used to identify a device on the internet) 
and private (used to identify a device among other devices). A device that is cconnected to the internet have both public and private IP adresses at the same time.The public IP address is given by your internet
service provider (ISP). There is two types of public IP adresses -> IPv4 (older version) and IPv6 (newer version).
-A MAC addreess(media access control) which is a unique address given to every device that can bbe found on the microchip board. ***This address can be spoofed.

    3. What does the term "IP" stand for? Internet Protocol
    4. What is each section of an IP address called? Octet
    5. How many sections (in digits) does an IP address have? 4
    6. What does the term "MAC" stand for? Media Access Control - mac address is uniqueto each device, but can be spoofed
    7. Deploy the interactive lab using the "View Site" button and spoof your MAC address to access the site.  What is the flag? THM{YOU_GOT_ON_TRYHACKME}

-Ping is a network tool which can be used to determine the performance of a connection between devices -> ping IP address or website URL

    8. What protocol does ping use? ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol. Ping is used to determine the time for ICMP packets to travel between devices on a network.'
    9. What is the syntax to ping 10.10.10.10? ping -c 4 10.10.10.10 - The -c is an options that specifies the numbers of packets to send.
    10. What flag do you get when you ping 8.8.8.8? THM{I_PINGED_THE_SERVER}

## Intro to LAN
-LAN (local area network) is the way the network is organized. Each type of organization has its prosand cons.
-Star topology: devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. Any information sent to a device in this topology is sent via the central device to which it connects.
Pros: highly scalable since all you need to do is connect the new device to the central one.
Cons: cabling and the purchase of dedicated networking equipment make this topology expensive. If the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data.
-Bus: devices are all connected along the same cable named backbone cable which is similar to the leaf off of a tree.
Pros: one of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up because of their expenses.
Cons: prone to become slow, difficult to troubleshoot (its difficult to identify which device is the problem), if there is a problem in the backbone, all devices can't receive/transmit data.
-Ring: devices are connected directly to each other to form a loop. It works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the right device.
Pros: little cabling, easy to troubleshoot, less prone to bottlenecks.
Cons: data travels in a non-efficient way, if a device stops working, the whole network also stops.

-Switches: they are devices that connect multiple devices (computer, printers, tvs, etc.) using ethernet. We usually find them in buisnesses, schools, etc.
-Routers: they are devices that connect multiple networks and pass data between them.

    1. What does LAN stand for? Local Area Network - Different type such as ring, star, bus
    2. What is the verb given to the job that Routers perform? Routing
    3. What device is used to centrally connect multiple devices on the local network and transmit data to the correct location? Switch
    4. What topology is cost-efficient to set up? Bus Topology
    5. What topology is expensive to set up and maintain? Star Topology
    6. Complete the interactive lab attached to this task. What is the flag given at the end? THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}

-Subnetting: its a term that means splitting the network into smaller network (ex: a buisness network has a smaller network only for HR or only for finance). The 3 main subnets are as follows: network address,
host address and default gateway:
Network Adress: this address identifies the start of the actual network. ex: a device with the IP address of 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0
Host Address: this address identifies the device in the subnet. ex: 192.168.1.100
Default Gateway: its a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network. These devices can use any host address but usually use either the first
or last host address in a network (.1 or .254). ex: 192.168.1.254

    7. What is the technical term for dividing a network up into smaller pieces? Subnetting
    8. How many bits are in a subnet mask? 32
    9. What is the range of a section (octet) of a subnet mask? 0-255
    10. What address is used to identify the start of a network? Network Address
    11. What address is used to identify devices within a network? Host Address
    12. What is the name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another network? Default Gateway

-ARP protocol: address resolution protocol is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network by allowing a device to associate a MAC address with an IP address on the network.
In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages: ARP Request and ARP Reply. The ARP request is a message broadcasted on the network
to other devices asking, "What is the mac address that owns this IP address?" When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an
ARP reply with its MAC address. The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its ARP cache for future use (its a place in the memory where the mapping is stored).

    13. What does ARP stand for? Address Resolution Protocol - Two types of messages, ARP Request and ARP Reply
    14. What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address? Request
    15. What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network? MAC Address
    16. What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network? IP Address

-DHCP protocol: dynamic host configuration protocol is used when a new device is introduce in an network and it doesnt have an IP adress. The protocol goes as follow:
1. DHCP discover: request to see if any DHCP servers are on the network
2. DHCP offer: server replies with an IP address the device could use
3. DHCP request: device sends a reply confirming the IP address
4. DHCP ack: servers replies with acknowledgment

    17. What type of DHCP packet is used by a device to retrieve an IP address? DHCP Discover
    18. What type of DHCP packet does a device send once it has been offered an IP address by the DHCP server? DHCP Request
    19. Finally, what is the last DHCP packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP server? DHCP ACK -ack stands for acknowledge

##  OSI Model
-OSI model: the open system interconnection model provides a universal framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data even if they don't have the
same funtion (ex a printer and a computer). It has 7 layers (from 7 to 1) and in everyone of them, pieces of data are added which is called encapsulation

    1. What does the "OSI" in "OSI Model" stand for? Open System Interconnection
    2. How many layers (in digits) does the OSI model have? 7 - Application. Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data link, Physical
    3. What is the key term for when pieces of information get added to data? Encapsulation

-Layer 7 (application): determine how the user should interac with data sent or received. Usually, applications will provide the user a GUI to interact with the data.

    4. What is the name of this Layer? Application
    5. What is the technical term that is given to the name of the software that users interact with? Graphical User Interface (GUI)

-Layer 6 (presentation): standardisation happens in this layer to make sure the data is in the "same language" everywhere so it can be handle the same way everywhere no matter the software. It acts
as a translator for the data to and from the layer 7. Security features such as encryption (like HTTPS) happens at this layer.

    6. What is the name of this Layer? Presentation
    7. What is the main purpose that this Layer acts as? Translator

-Layer 5 (session): this layer will create a connection (synchronise) with the other device that the data is destined for. Then it will begin to divide up the data sent into smaller chunks
of data and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time. This dividing up is beneficial because if the connection is lost, only the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to be sent again.

    8. What is the name of this Layer? Session
    9. What is the technical term for when a connection is successfully established? Session
    10. What is the technical term for "small chunks of data"? Packets

-Layer 4 (transport): the data is being transmistted in this layer following one of the two protocols:
1. TCP: transmission control protocol -> used in file sharing, sending emails, internet browsing, and situations where it is important to have an accurate data.
Pros: guarantees the accuracy of data, synchronises two devices to prevent each other from being flooded with data, Performs a lot more processes for reliability.
Cons: requires a reliable connection, If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used, TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work has to be
done by the devices using this protocol.
2. UDP: user datagram protocol -> used in situations where data accuracy is not important ex video streaming.
Pros: much faster than TCP
Cons: doesn't care if data is received, unstable connection results in bad experience for user

    11. What is the name of this Layer? Transport
    12. What does TCP stand for? Transmission Control Protocol
    13. What does UDP stand for? User Datagram Protocol
    14. What protocol guarantees the accuracy of data? TCP
    15. What protocol doesn't care if data is received or not by the other device? UDP
    16. What protocol would an application such as an email client use? TCP
    17. What protocol would an application that downloads files use? TCP
    18. What protocol would an application that streams video use? UDP

-Layer 3 (network): the most optimal (shortest and reliable) path the data will be sent in will be determined (routing) using both IP addresses of network.

    19. What is the name of this Layer? Network
    20. Will packets take the most optimal route across a network? (Y/N) Y
    21. What does the acronym "OSPF" stand for? OpenShortest Path First
    22. What does the acronym "RIP" stand for? Routing Information Protocol
    23. What type of addresses are dealt with at this layer? IP Address

-Layer 2 (data link): this layer adds the MAC address of the receiving endpoint to the network layer. It also present the data in a format suitable for transmission.

    24. What is the name of this Layer? Data Link
    25. What is the name of the piece of hardware that all networked devices come with? Network Interface Card (NIC)

-Layer 1 (physical): referes to the physical components of hardware used in networking. Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system.

    26. What is the name of this Layer? Physical
    27. What is the name of the numbering system that is both 0's and 1's? Binary
    28. What is the name of the cables that are used to connect devices? Ethernet Cables

## Packets & Frames
-Packets and frames both contains data, but are different. A frame is at layer 2 (no IP address) whereas a packet is at layer 3 and will contain a header with many information:
1. Time to Live: this field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host
2. Checksum: this field provides integrity checking for protocols.  If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt.
3. Source Address: the IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from so that data knows where to return to.
4. Destination Address: the device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.
The relation between a packet and a frame is like putting an envelope within an envelope and sending it away. The first envelope will be the packet that you mail, but once it is opened, the envelope within
still exists and contains data (this is a frame). The process of adding information (from frame to packets) is called encapsulation and the reverse (from packet to frame) is called de-encapsulation. 
Packets and frames are little piece of data which when brought back together at the receiving network/device make a bigger data (ex: a picture is divided in many different part and each part is being sent 
to the receiving device which brings back the whole picture together.

    1. What is the name for a piece of data when it does have IP addressing information? Packet
    2. What is the name for a piece of data when it does not have IP addressing information? Frame

-TCP: as explained previously, the TCP is one of the protocol used in layer 4 transport. TCP packets contains headers (section of information) that are added from encapsulation.
    3. What is the header in a TCP packet that ensures the integrity of data? Checksum
    4. Provide the order of a normal Three-way handshake (with each step separated by a comma). Syn, syn/ack, ack
    5. What does the term "UDP" stand for? User Datagram Protocol
    6. What type of connection is "UDP"? Stateless
    7. What protocol would you use to transfer a file? TCP
    8. What protocol would you use to have a video call? UDP
